# Picard

I am stoked about the upcoming series [Picard](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/once-again-engage-picard-trailer-feels-like-the-next-next-generation/). Some watch lists are available online ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/bs5vz7/ten_tng_episodes_to_prepare_for_star_trek_picard/), [2](https://www.trekbbs.com/threads/watch-list-to-prep-for-st-picard.300042/), [3](https://twitter.com/VK_HM/status/1152677872458457093)), but I want to watch things in order, so I needed a master list.

So, of course, I made a spreadsheet. But, what if people have suggestions? Google Sheets comments aren't the right way to handle that. I wanted pull requests. So here I am, making a web site to display a CSV as a table, in case someone wants to open a PR suggesting more episodses to watch to get ready for Picard!
